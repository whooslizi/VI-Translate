"""Find, download, and stage a newer release, then hand the swap to a helper.

The app ships as a one-folder build that locks its own DLLs while it runs, so
it can never replace itself in place. What it can do is unpack the new build
next to the old one and start a detached PowerShell helper that waits for this
process to exit, moves the two folders, and starts the new executable. Every
function here is either that staging work or one of the checks that decide
whether it is safe to attempt it. When any of them says no, the caller falls
back to what this module used to do alone: point at the release page.
